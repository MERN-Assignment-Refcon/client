## Testing the scrolling quote form Sam implemented:

### Date: 21/1/20
### Time: 11AM

### Problems Found:
### Covers the entire screen on mobile. RESOLVED 

    When using mobile, it doesn't scale properly and ends up scrolling with the screen while covering about 60% of it.

### Carousel arrows stopped working because of it. RESOLVED
    
    The Carousel arrow movement stopped working due to it. It could still be moved by clicking the tabs at the botton and continued to scroll automatically.

### Scrolling Nav only worked at the top of the screen. RESOLVED    

    The links only worked while the scrolling navbar was the top of the page. While it did scroll with the screen it lost all functionallity.
